# Hour of Code 2018 

<h3>Solve the following questions:</h3>

<h2>1.</h2> Write a program that prints all the prime numbers between ‘x’ and ‘y’, inclusive of ‘x’ and ‘y’ without using a loop where ‘x’ and ‘y’ will be specified by the user.

__________________________________________________________________________________________

<h2>2.</h2> Write a program to decode a string of messages made up of seemingly random characters and of variable lengths. For example:

“aWk60#ase2> o_0^4alis5L”

To decode this string, you simply add the numbers in each block. A block is a continuous string without a space:

aWk60#ase2> → 6 + 0 + 2 = 8
o_0^4alis5L → 0 + 4 + 5 = 9  

Each number corresponds to a letter of the alphabet such that:
0 = ‘’
1 = ‘a’
2 = ‘b’

and so on. Thus, 8 9 → ‘hi’ If sum of digits goes over 26, loop back to zero. Thus, 

“aWk60#ase2> o_2^293alis874L” → 6+0+2=8, 2+2+9+3+8+7+4=35 → 8, 9 → “hi”

<h2>3.</h2> Any natural number is called as a z-prime if it has exactly z prime factors.

For ex:
z = 2 → 4 (2,2), 6 (2,3), 9 (3,3), 10 (2,5)
z = 3 →  8, 12, 18, 20
z = 5 →  32, 48, 72, 80

  a. Write a function findZprimes which accepts parameters k, start and end and returns an array or list or slice depending on the language of the k-primes between and inclusive of ‘start’ and ‘end’.


  b. Write a function findZprimeAddends which accepts a number ‘n’ and returns an array of all possible 3 numbers ‘p’, ‘q’ and ‘r’ such that:
p is 1-prime
q is 3-prime
r is 7-prime
p + q + r = n

<h2>Bonus Question</h2>

<h2>4.</h2> Write a Program with two functions to encode and decode to and from Base64 respectively. Do not use in built functions for base64 directly. Read more about base64 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">here</a>.
